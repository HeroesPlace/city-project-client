## Introduction

**City Project [Client]** is the frontend interface of the [City Project](https://github.com/heroes-place/city-project) open-source video game. City Project is a hybrid between an MMORPG and a strategy game, where players join the world, develop their characters, create villages, and conquer territories in a fully player-shaped universe.

## Technologies

Our philosophy revolves around open-source principles. Every tool and technology used has been chosen with the open-source mindset:
- **socket.io-client**: Real-time bidirectional event-based communication. We use socket.io-client to handle seamless real-time communication between the server and clients.
- **VueJS**:  VueJS handles the reactive user interface for seamless game interaction.
- **Phaser**: A fast, open-source HTML5 game framework. Phaser is used to render the interactive game world for City Project.
